  "cruise_purpose": "The objectives are to: 1) determine the spring distribution and relative abundance of fish and invertebrate species found on the continental shelf and upper slope, including the collection of additional biological information following the pre-established sampling plan at the direction of the Chief Scientist; 2) opportunistically evaluate survey gear efficiency, methods, or survey related equipment that may benefit the trawl survey and fish stock assessments; 3) collect oceanographic data including CTD casts and bongo tows at selected stations; 4) opportunistically collect acoustic data along cruise tracks with the EK-60 and ME-70 acoustic systems.",
